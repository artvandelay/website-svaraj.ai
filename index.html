        <h1>Introducing Svaraj AI</h1>
        <p>
            At Svaraj AI, we imagine a future where personal digital data is untouchable—no longer bought, sold, or exploited for profit. Just as humanity has moved beyond the commodification of human bodies, we believe it’s time to protect the sanctity of personal identity in the digital age.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our mission is to create AI systems that empower individuals rather than manipulate them. We are building a future where AI aligns only with its user, not corporations, governments, or hidden agendas.
        </p>
        <h2>What We Are Building</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accessible:</strong> Lightweight and affordable AI, ensuring everyone can benefit without barriers.</li>
            <li><strong>Loyal:</strong> AI that is always on and present, acting solely in the best interests of its user.</li>
            <li><strong>Private:</strong> Personal data is cryptographically secured and remains on your device, inaccessible to external actors—unlockable only by you through decentralized or institutional IDs.</li>
            <li><strong>Empowering:</strong> A trustworthy digital companion, helping you navigate the digital world with confidence—from apps to payments—while protecting your autonomy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We are building an ecosystem of decentralized servers and AI systems designed for safety, privacy, and user empowerment. This infrastructure ensures that the benefits of AI are distributed fairly and that people, not institutions, remain in control of their own data and decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to lead humanity toward a future where AI is a loyal partner in navigating the complexities of the digital universe—lightweight, always on, and looking out for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stay tuned as we work to turn this vision into reality. <strong>Coming Soon!</strong>
